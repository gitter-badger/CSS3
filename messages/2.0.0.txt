WELCOME TO 2.0!

CSS3 has been rewritten from scratch using the awesome new sublime-syntax
system. Here are the improvements:

    FEATURES
    - Variables
    - HTML5 custom element selectors
    - Bunch of new stuff from the spec that no browser supports and no one's
      ever heard of
    - Flags unbalanced parentheses and curly braces
    - Lots of new completions
    - Completions are less noisy and more up-to-date

    CORRECTNESS
    - Squashed a bunch of annoying highlighting bugs. You know the ones.
    - Made another pass over all the W3C specs, so it's even more comprehensive
      than before

    PERFORMANCE
    - All the regexes have been written for Sublime's new custom regex engine.
      Both the regexes AND the regex engine are much faster. You will notice
      the difference when working with large CSS files.
    - Removed the W3C Validator. It slowed things down and not everybody used
      it. Based on user feedback, I decided to release it as a separate package
      (forthcoming).

IMPORTANT

    1) Make sure you're running the latest version of Sublime Text 3.

    2) You should delete all the .sublime-settings files in your Packages/CSS3/
       directory. All those settings were for the validator, which is gone.
       CSS3 2.0 has no knobs.

    3) I recommend adding these two settings to your User Settings. By default, Sublime
       will not offer completions inside other completions. In other words, the
       completions menu is suppressed while you're tabbing through a snippet. This
       can prevent a lot of the CSS3 completions from appearing. To fix this, set these
       keys to true:

            "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
            "auto_complete_with_fields": true,

BUG REPORTING

    400+ properties. 40+ specs. CSS is frickin' huge! I know stuff gets by me.
    So if you notice something wrong, please take a moment to open an issue.
    Thanks very much!
