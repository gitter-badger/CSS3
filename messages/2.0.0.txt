WELCOME TO 2.0!

CSS3 has been rewritten from scratch using the awesome new sublime-syntax
system. Here are the improvements:

	FEATURES
	- Variables
	- HTML5 custom element selectors
	- Bunch of new stuff from the spec that no browser supports and no one's
	  ever heard of.
	- Flags unbalanced parentheses and curly braces
	- Completions are less noisy and more up-to-date.

	CORRECTNESS
	- Squashed a bunch of annoying highlighting bugs. You know the ones.
	- Made another pass over all the W3C specs, so it's even more comprehensive
	  than before.

	PERFORMANCE
	- All the regexes have been written for Sublime's new custom regex engine.
	  Both the regexes AND the regex engine are much faster. You will notice
	  the difference when working with large CSS files.
	- Removed the W3C Validator. It slowed things down and not everybody used
	  it. If you miss the validator, don't worry! It will release it as a
	  separate package.

IMPORTANT

	1) Make sure you're running the latest version of Sublime Text 3.

	2) You should delete all the .sublime-settings files in your Packages/CSS3/
	directory. All those settings were for the validator, which is gone.

BUG REPORTING

	400+ properties. 41 specs. CSS is frickin' huge! I know stuff gets by me.
	So please, if you notice some bad highlighting or incorrect completions,
	please take a moment to open an issue. Thanks!
