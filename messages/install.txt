Thank you for installing CSS3!

This plugin requires Sublime Text 3 build 3103 or greater.

It's strongly recommended that you disable the default CSS package. Its
completions will interfere with the improved CSS3 completions.

    Mac:       cmd+shift+p  -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS
    Linux/Win: ctrl+shift+p -> Package Control: Disable Package -> CSS

If you have Emmet installed, its completions will drown out the completions in
CSS3. You can disable Emmet's completions by adding the following lines to your
Emmet package settings:

    "show_css_completions": false,
    "disable_tab_abbreviations_for_scopes": "source.css"

I recommend adding these two settings to your User Settings. By default, Sublime
will not offer completions inside other completions. In other words, the
completions menu is suppressed while you're tabbing through a snippet. This
can prevent a lot of the CSS3 completions from appearing. To fix this, set these
keys to true:

    "auto_complete_commit_on_tab": true,
    "auto_complete_with_fields": true,

That's it. Enjoy the plugin. If you have any problems, please open an issue on
GitHub and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
