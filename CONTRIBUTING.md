## Create an issue

Your pull request is more likely to be accepted if you open an issue first. This
gives me a chance to provide early feedback so you don't waste your time. For
example, you might think it's weird that some property isn't highlighted, when
it's actually a [known bad property](https://gist.github.com/y0ssar1an/bb95223148e486acbe7a).

Check the list of open issues to see if your issue already exists.

## Make your changes

Fork the `develop` branch, not `master`. `master` is the release branch that gets
scanned every hour by the Package Control bot.

## Submit your PR

Thanks for helping out! It's a lot of work to keep CSS3 up to date with the
latest browser/spec changes. Stuff gets by me. Any update is appreciated, no
matter how small.
